I would like to say that there is no specific example for the Factory design pattern, as is the case with other design patterns.
The scenario here was entirely related to the problem of running codes containing the desired values according to the Localization values,
which is a problem I encountered in real life. Before this, we would decide which code should be run in an if-else block according to the language value,
which was a hard-coded example and was an application that decreased readability and increased complexity over time, and was not very useful.
After our senior developer mentioned that it might be a good idea to use this pattern for this type of problem, we got to work and fixed the code as desired.
A more flexible and useful version of the code is now used in the project.

Hope theese codes are helpfully for you :)

If you want to see real life code example picture for this pattern maybe you can look up my medium post;
